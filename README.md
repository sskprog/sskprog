## Hi there, I'm Stanislav Kushnir! 👋

I'm a passionate **FullStack Web Developer** with a strong background in **System Administration** and **Cybersecurity**. Before diving into programming, I spent years configuring and maintaining Windows and Linux servers, setting up web servers, internet gateways, mail servers and ensuring robust system security. This experience gave me a deep understanding of infrastructure, performance optimization, and secure development practices.

Now, I focus on building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and turning ideas into functional, elegant solutions. Whether it's crafting responsive UIs or designing robust APIs, I'm always eager to learn and apply new technologies.

🚧 **Currently working on:**
- **Rewriting [oncad.ru](https://oncad.ru/):** A service for engineering designers to automate the design process. Originally built with **Yii2** and **VueJS2**, I'm now modernizing it using **Laravel** and **VueJS3** with **Composition API** for better performance and maintainability.

🌱 **Learning:**
- **DevOps methodologies** (CI/CD, infrastructure as code, automation)
- **Advanced CI/CD pipelines** for seamless deployment

💬 **Let's talk about:** Web development, system infrastructure, cybersecurity, or tech innovations!
