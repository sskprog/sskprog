### Hi there, I'm Stanislav Kushnir! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate **FullStack Web Developer** with a strong background in **System Administration** and **Cybersecurity**. Before diving into programming, I spent years configuring and maintaining Windows and Linux servers, setting up web servers, internet gateways, and ensuring robust system security. This experience gave me a deep understanding of infrastructure, performance optimization, and secure development practices.

Now, I focus on building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and turning ideas into functional, elegant solutions. Whether it's crafting responsive UIs or designing robust APIs, I'm always eager to learn and apply new technologies.

ðŸš§ **Currently working on:**
- **Rewriting [oncad.ru](https://oncad.ru/):** A service for engineering designers to automate the design process. Originally built with **Yii2** and **VueJS2**, I'm now modernizing it using **Laravel** and **VueJS3** with **Composition API** for better performance and maintainability.

ðŸŒ± **Learning:**
- **DevOps methodologies** (CI/CD, infrastructure as code, automation)
- **Advanced CI/CD pipelines** for seamless deployment

ðŸ’¬ **Let's talk about:** Web development, system infrastructure, cybersecurity, or tech innovations!
